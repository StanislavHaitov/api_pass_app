# To find the Minikube IP and NodePort that is assigned to your service:
minikube -p project-app ip
kubectl get svc passapp -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'

# Once you have the Minikube IP and the NodePort, you can access your app
http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>/password/
# For example:
http://192.168.58.2:31606/password/

# After PC reboot, need restart Minikube profile:
minikube -p project-app start
